Fantasy Football Draft Organizer 2013
-------------------------------------

Summary: 
This program scrapes consensus stat projections from
http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/projections for QBs, RBs, WRs, and TEs. It compiles
stats for each player, applies configurable league point rules, and creates an approximate
total year season point projection. Projections are given marginal value to increase value 
of higher "tier" players. Further applies inflation for keeper leagues due to value being 
lost from the player pool. Output is stored to a tab delimited file to import in a 
spreadsheet for further manipulation. Currently optimized for auction leagues only.

Requirements:
Python 3.3

Usage:
Copy the source to your environment and edit ff_draft_organizer_2013.py. Input data
in the USER DEFINES section for specific league scoring rules, auction money, keeper 
prices/value, and roster settings.

Run:
> python ff_draft_organizer_2013.py
